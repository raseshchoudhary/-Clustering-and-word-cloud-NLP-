# What is clustering.

I any given dataset there are a number of data point, some of these data points may be similar in nature and they are better understoof of grouped together. This is what we mean by clustering.

Then the question arises what should be the ideal number of cluster, for this we create an elbow plot to find the point where the inertia starts to decrease at a negligible rate. 

In this case I have used a clustering type known as K-means clustering.

# Steps

1.Cleaned the data

2.Vectorized the data to convert into numbers

3.Made the clusters using K-means clustering by filling the vectorised data in the model

4.Made word clouds

# Words clouds.

After dividing the data into clustering, I have picked each and every cluster and made a word cloud out of it. The idea is to see the quality of the clusters formed. 

If each and every word cloud contain words that make a theme, then we can be sure that clusters are of good quality and are sensible.
